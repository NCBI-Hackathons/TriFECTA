    <textblock>
      This phase III trial studies how well response and biology-based risk factor-guided therapy
      works in treating younger patients with non-high risk neuroblastoma. Sometimes a tumor may
      not need treatment until it progresses. In this case, observation may be sufficient.
      Measuring biomarkers in tumor cells may help plan when effective treatment is necessary and
      what the best treatment is. Response and biology-based risk factor-guided therapy may be
      effective in treating patients with non-high risk neuroblastoma and may help to avoid some of
      the risks and side effects related to standard treatment.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To eliminate therapy as the initial approach for infants &lt; 12 months of age with small
      International Neuroblastoma Risk Group (INRG) stage L1 neuroblastoma while maintaining an
      overall survival (OS) of 99%.

      II. To eliminate therapy as the initial approach for non-high-risk patients &lt; 18 months of
      age with localized neuroblastoma and favorable biology (histologic and genomic features)
      while maintaining an OS of 99%.

      III. To achieve a 3-year OS of &gt; 81% for infants &lt; 18 months of age with INRG stage Ms
      neuroblastoma using objective criteria for early initiation of a response-based treatment
      algorithm.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To describe the time to intervention or tumor progression, type of intervention and site
      of progression for patients with localized neuroblastoma who experience progression after an
      initial period of observation.

      II. To characterize the pharmacokinetic profile of the chemotherapeutic agents carboplatin
      and etoposide in patients with stage Ms disease.

      III. To define the genomic profile of tumors from patients with non-high-risk neuroblastoma
      both at initial biopsy and at the time of subsequent biopsy or surgical resection.

      IV. To describe the histology of tumor specimens obtained at the time of subsequent biopsy or
      surgical resection.

      V. To determine the salvage rate (OS) of patients with tumor relapse or disease progression.

      VI. To determine the procedural complication rate (initial biopsy, resection [intraoperative
      and postoperative], subsequent biopsy) and correlate with the degree of surgical resection.

      VII. To determine the rate of reduction in image defined risk factors (IDRF) in L2 tumors
      following observation or chemotherapy.

      OUTLINE: Patients are assigned to 1 of 3 treatment groups.

      GROUP A: Patients undergo clinical observation for 96 weeks in the absence disease
      progression.

      GROUP B: Patients undergo clinical observation for 3 years in the absence of disease
      progression. Upon disease progression, patients undergo surgery or receive first-line
      chemotherapy comprising carboplatin intravenously (IV) over 1 hour on day 1 (courses 1, 2, 4,
      6, and 7), etoposide IV over 1 hour on days 1-3 (courses 1, 3, 4, 5, and 7), cyclophosphamide
      IV over 1 hour on day 1 (courses 2, 3, 5, 6, and 8), and doxorubicin hydrochloride IV over 15
      minutes on day 1 (courses 2, 4, 6 and 8). Treatment with chemotherapy repeats every 21 days
      for 2-8 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Once a
      partial response (PR) or better is achieved, patients undergo clinical observation for 3
      years.

      GROUP C: Patients at high risk for deterioration and a poor outcome immediately receive
      first-line chemotherapy as in Group B. All other patients undergo clinical observation for 3
      years in the absence of disease progression. Upon disease progression, patients receive
      first-line chemotherapy as in Group B. Once a PR or better is achieved, patients undergo
      clinical observation for 3 years.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up annually for 3 years.

    <time_frame>From the date of enrollment until death or until last contact if the patient is alive, assessed up to 3 years</time_frame>
    <description>Will be addressed by a one-sample, one-sided log-rank test comparison of the overall survival of patients in each individual stratum to the benchmark 3-year OS rate of 99%. If the log-rank test does not detect a statistically significant reduction from 99% and if the EFS interim monitoring rule is not triggered, then it may be assumed that a 3-year OS rate consistent with 99% has been maintained within each stratum.</description>
