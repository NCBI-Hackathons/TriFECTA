  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      The purpose of this study is to determine the efficacy and safety of pembrolizumab (MK-3475)
      with or without chemotherapy versus chemotherapy alone in participants with advanced or
      metastatic urothelial carcinoma (bladder cancer).

      The primary hypotheses are that pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy is superior to chemotherapy
      alone with respect to Progression-free Survival (PFS) and Overall Survival (OS) in
      participants with programmed cell death ligand 1 (PD-L1) positive tumors (Combined Positive
      Score [CPS] ≥10%) and in all participants (includes those participants with PD-L1 positive
      tumors and those with PD-L1 negative tumors [CPS &lt;10%]).

             investigator/radiology assessment.
