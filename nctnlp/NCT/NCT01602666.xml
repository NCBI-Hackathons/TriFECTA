      This phase II trial studies how well chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy work in
      treating younger patients with newly diagnosed central nervous system germ cell tumors that
      have not spread to other parts of the brain, spinal canal, or body (localized). Drugs used as
      chemotherapy, such as carboplatin, etoposide, and ifosfamide, work in different ways to stop
      the growth of tumor cells, either by killing the cells, by stopping them from dividing, or by
      stopping them from spreading. Radiation therapy uses high-energy x rays to kill tumor cells.
      Giving chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy may kill more tumor cells.

      PRIMARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To determine, as measured by the 3-year progression-free survival (PFS) rate and patterns
      of failure, whether dose and volume of irradiation can be safely reduced to 30.6 Gy whole
      ventricular-field irradiation (WVI) plus 23.4 Gy primary site boost instead of 36 Gy
      craniospinal irradiation (CSI) plus primary site boost in the subgroup of children and young
      adults (ages 3 to =&lt; 21 years) with localized nongerminomatous germ cell tumor (NGGCT) who
      have a magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and tumor marker criteria (cerebrospinal fluid [CSF]
      and serum) for confirmed complete response (CR) or partial response (PR) to induction
      chemotherapy and negative serum and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) tumor markers OR in patients
      who have less than a PR after induction chemotherapy with negative tumor markers who undergo
      a second-look surgery and are found to have only mature teratoma, residual scar or fibrosis
      and fit the definition of CR/PR after second-look surgery.

      II. To determine, as measured by the 3-year PFS rate and patterns of failure, whether
      simplified chemotherapy followed by dose-reduced radiation therapy is effective for treating
      children and young adults (ages 3 to =&lt; 21 years) with localized primary central nervous
      system (CNS) germinoma who present with serum and/or CSF human chorionic gonadotropin-beta
      (hCGbeta) =&lt; 50 mIU/mL.

      III. To prospectively evaluate and longitudinally model the cognitive, social, and behavioral
      functioning of children and young adults who are treated with reduced radiation dose and
      volume of irradiation in Stratum 1 (NGGCT) and with dose-reduced radiation therapy in Stratum
      2 (germinoma) using the ALTE07C1 protocol.

      SECONDARY OBJECTIVES:

      I. To estimate the PFS and overall survival (OS) distributions of patients with NGGCT treated
      with 30.6 Gy WVI and involved-field radiation therapy (IFR) focal boost to 54 Gy.

      II. To estimate the PFS and OS distributions of localized germinoma patients who present with
      a) serum and/or CSF hCGbeta =&lt; 50 mIU/mL and b) serum and/or CSF hCGbeta &gt; 50 mIU/mL and =&lt;
      100 mIU/mL.

      OUTLINE:

      STRATUM I (NGGCT): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin intravenously
      (IV) over 15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3 of courses
      1, 3, and 5. Patients also receive ifosfamide IV over 60 minutes and etoposide over 60-120
      minutes on days 1-5 of courses 2, 4, and 6. Treatment repeats every 21 days for 6 courses in
      the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity. Patients achieving CR or PR
      undergo 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3DRT) or intensity modulated radiation
      therapy (IMRT) once daily (QD) 5 days a week for 6 weeks. Patients with normalization of
      markers who fail to achieve CR or PR are strongly recommended to undergo second-look surgery.
      Patients who achieve CR or PR after second-look surgery undergo 3DRT or IMRT QD 5 days a week
      for 6 weeks.

      STRATUM II (GERMINOMA): Patients receive induction therapy comprising carboplatin IV over
      15-60 minutes on day 1 and etoposide IV over 60-120 minutes on days 1-3. Treatment repeats
      every 21 days for 4 courses in the absence of disease progression or unacceptable toxicity.
      Patients with CR or continued CR (CCR) undergo 3DRT or IMRT QD 5 days a week for 4 weeks.
      Patients with normalization of markers who fail to achieve CR or PR are strongly recommended
      to undergo second-look surgery. Patients found to have fibrosis, scar, mature teratoma, or
      non-viable tumor undergo 3DRT or IMRT QD 5 days a week for 4 weeks. Patients with stable
      disease (SD) or PR with &gt; 0.5 cm (suprasellar) or &gt; 1 cm (pineal) but =&lt; 1.5 cm residual
      disease do not undergo second-look surgery and undergo 3DRT or IMRT QD 5 days a week for 4
      weeks.

      After completion of study treatment, patients are followed up at 3, 6, and 9 months, every 4
      months for 24 months, 30 months, and then annually for up to 60 months.

             contraindicated; ventricular CSF obtained at the time of CSF diversion procedure (if
             performed) is acceptable for tumor markers but lumbar CSF is preferred; in case CSF
             diversion and biopsy/surgery are combined, CSF tumor markers should be collected first
