  <brief_summary>
    <textblock>
      This study will evaluate patients with blood cell cancers who are going to have an allogeneic
      (donor) blood stem cell transplant from a partially matched relative. The research study will
      test whether immune cells, called T cells, which come from the donor relative and are
      specially grown in the laboratory and then given back to the patient along with the stem cell
      transplant (T cell addback), can help the immune system recover faster after the transplant.
      As a safety measure, these T cells have been &quot;programmed&quot; with a &quot;self-destruct switch&quot; so
      that if, after they have been given to the patient, the T cells start to react against the
      tissues (called &quot;graft versus host&quot; disease, GVHD), the T cells can be destroyed.

      This is a Phase1/2 dose escalation study evaluating the safety and feasibility of BPX-501
      infused after partially mismatched, related (haploidentical), T cell-depleted HSCT. The
      purpose of this clinical trial is to determine whether BPX-501 infusion can facilitate
      engraftment, enhance immune reconstitution and potentially improve the graft versus leukemia
      (GVL) effect, with the potential for reducing the severity and duration of severe acute graft
      versus host disease (GvHD). The trial will evaluate the treatment of GvHD by the infusion of
      dimerizer drug (AP1903) in those subjects who present with severe GvHD (Grades III and IV) as
      well as those subjects with Grade I and II who progress or do not respond to corticosteroid
      therapy within 4 days.
