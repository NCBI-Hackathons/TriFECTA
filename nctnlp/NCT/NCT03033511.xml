             radioimmunoconjugates, T-cell or other cell-based or biologic therapies, or any other
             anti-cancer therapy than that described in inclusion criteria

          -  Any disease-directed radiotherapy (except prophylactic cranial irradiation or
             pre-planned radiotherapy for CNS metastases present prior to start of first-line
             therapy and non-progressing) after last dose of first-line chemotherapy.

          -  Prior exposure to a pyrrolobenzodiazepine (PBD)- or indolinobenzodiazepine-based drug,
             prior participation in a rovalpituzumab tesirine clinical trial, or known
